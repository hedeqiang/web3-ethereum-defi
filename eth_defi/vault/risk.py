    This risk profile classification is about the technical risk of the vault.
    Outside technical risk, you have market risk, volatility risk and such risk factors which can be modelled separately using finance best practices.

    - Used to classify vaults by their risk profile
    - How this vault risk compares to other vaults (All vaults are high risk compared to the traditional finance)
    - Having a point of time technical audit does not meaningfully lower the risk, because all systems should be evaluated as a whole
      and have continuous transparency and open source development to be considered low risk.

    The unverified smart contracts are the biggest red flag, because
    we cannot verify if they match what the audit says (if there is any).
